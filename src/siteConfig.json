    "title": "About Josh",
    "content": "I'm Josh Withers ‚Äî the celebrant, web strategist, and microphone-wielding mischief-maker you call when words matter. I marry legends around the world with ceremonies that are real, joyful, and wildly personal. I co-run The Elopement Collective with my wife Britt, help celebrants and creative business owners grow what matters, and build everything I do around being a present husband and dad in Tasmania. No fluff. No filler. Just meaningful work for people who care."
